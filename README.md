# FFT_on_smt32

This project implements a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on an STM32 microcontroller, designed for efficient signal processing applications, especially for embedded systems. more detailed explenations available as coments in the code.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate an optimized FFT implementation for STM32. The project leverages the `libopencm3` library for low-level STM32 functions.

## Folder Structure
- **libopencm3**: The core library providing STM32 peripheral access.
- **my-common-code**: Contains headers.
- **my-project**: Main project files specific to FFT functionality.
- **py_src**: Python scripts that may assist in data processing or analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) library for STM32.
    
### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dm1Tr0/FFT_on_smt32.git
